# InvestIQ v2

InvestIQ v2 is a Next.js 13+ (App Router) TypeScript project for a startup-focused investment intelligence dashboard. It provides UI components, a dashboard, and utilities to evaluate companies, with several ready-made components and a modern design system.

## Key features

- Next.js 13 App Router with TypeScript
- Reusable UI primitives under `components/ui/` (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
- Pages and nested routes under `app/` (dashboard, company pages)
- Small library helpers in `lib/` and hooks in `hooks/`
- Tailwind / PostCSS powered styling (see `postcss.config.mjs`)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended)
- pnpm (the project uses pnpm lockfile)
- Git (optional)

## Setup (PowerShell)

Open a terminal in the project root and run:

```pwsh
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# run development server
pnpm dev

# build for production
pnpm build

# start production server
pnpm start
```

If you prefer npm or yarn, you can convert commands accordingly, but pnpm is recommended.

## Available scripts

Scripts are defined in `package.json`. Common ones:

- `dev` - Run Next.js in development mode
- `build` - Build the app for production
- `start` - Start the production server
- `lint` - Run linters (if configured)

Run scripts with pnpm e.g. `pnpm dev`.

## Project structure

- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `components/` - React components and UI primitives
- `components/ui/` - Small design system primitives (buttons, inputs, toasts)
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `lib/` - Utility functions
- `public/` - Static assets
- `styles/` - Global styles

## Contact

For questions, reach out to the maintainers or open an issue in the repository.

## Platform notes & troubleshooting

- This project was developed and tested on Windows using PowerShell. The example commands above use `pwsh` syntax. On macOS/Linux use the same commands in your shell (bash/zsh).
- If `pnpm` is not installed, install it globally with `npm i -g pnpm` or use `npx pnpm` for a one-off run.
- If you encounter TypeScript or lint errors during development, run `pnpm lint` (if configured) or inspect the terminal output to locate the failing file.
- Common Next.js issues:
	- Port already in use: set `PORT` env var before starting, e.g. `PORT=3001 pnpm dev` (on PowerShell use `$env:PORT=3001; pnpm dev`).
	- Fast refresh not working: try stopping and restarting the dev server.

## Small checklist (developer)

- [ ] Add `LICENSE` if you want to publish
- [ ] Add project badges (build, license, coverage)
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md for contributor guidelines
